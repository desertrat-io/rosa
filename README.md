# Rosa - The Cloud Framework for PHP

Experiment in creating a framework. Rosa provides a system by which

creating applications that leverage cloud services is simple, providing

as much as possible out of the box, with the ability to extend to your

own cloud services in whichever way you need. Or, use Rosa as a basic

MVC framework on its own, just keep in mind the cloud.
